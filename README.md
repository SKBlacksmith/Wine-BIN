GNU C Library explanation: (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/" target="_blank">glibc</a>). If your version of glibc is lower than the one I used to build the binaries, you should compile your own build from the sources provided. To find out what version your distribution has, use the following command: ldd --version
